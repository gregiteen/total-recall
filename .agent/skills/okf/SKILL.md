# Google Open Knowledge Format (OKF)

> OKF is a vendor-neutral, lightweight open specification introduced by Google Cloud in June 2026.
> It formalizes the "LLM-wiki" pattern by organizing organizational knowledge as a directory of standard Markdown files.

## Official Resources

- **GitHub Repository**: [GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog)
- **OKF Specification**: [SPEC.md](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog/blob/main/okf/SPEC.md)
- **Announcement**: [Google Cloud blog, 2026-06-12](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/how-the-open-knowledge-format-can-improve-data-sharing)

*(Note: Do not confuse this with the Open Knowledge Foundation. This is the technical spec for AI agent context.)*

## Core Characteristics

OKF solves the "context problem" for AI agents by providing a unified, interoperable format that can be consumed by various systems, LLMs, and humans alike without needing complex translation or SDKs.

1. **Simple Structure**: An OKF bundle is simply a directory of standard Markdown files.
2. **YAML Frontmatter**: Every file MUST include YAML frontmatter.
3. **Mandatory Field**: The base OKF spec requires `type`; Google's reference tooling also validates `title`, `description`, and `timestamp`.
4. **Interoperable Metadata**: SSSS treats `type`, `title`, `description`, and `timestamp` as mandatory universal metadata, with `resource`, `tags`, and `aliases` as portable enrichment fields.

## How SSSS Relates to OKF

There is **no formal relationship** between SSSS and OKF — no adoption announcement, no cross-reference from Google's side, no conformance program to certify against. SSSS targets OKF v0.1 compatibility as a first-class interoperability requirement: every SSSS document primitive must carry `type`, `title`, `description`, and `timestamp`, and OKF export surfaces must be plain Markdown directory trees using OKF reserved `index.md` / `log.md` semantics.

SSSS adds, on top of that shared Markdown+YAML substrate, its own primitives OKF does not define: the **Operation Contract** (idempotent mutation envelopes), the **Type Registry** (`registry/core.json`), portability classification, and **leases**.

**When developing for SSSS, keep it interoperable with OKF's concept model:**
- Never introduce binary blobs into the SSSS vault.
- Never use alternative metadata storage (like a separate database table) for document properties that belong in the YAML frontmatter.
- Always include `type`, `title`, `description`, and `timestamp`; prefer `resource`, `tags`, and `aliases` when they fit naturally.

## Tracking OKF

The OKF specification evolves in the upstream `GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog` repository (Apache-2.0, verified real and active). Periodically check the upstream OKF spec for new metadata conventions worth voluntarily adopting into SSSS — but treat it as prior art to learn from, not a standard SSSS answers to.
